                    <p> Seated along the Kashmir Highway, the Islamabad Campus holds in view the capital city, with mystic thoughtfulness. A majestic banyan tree strikes the eye of the visitor before the overshadowed Campus's beauty can capture his attention. The visitor experiences an instantaneous dilemma. He does not know whether to admire the panoramic scenery of the city, which lies before his eyes or marvel the academic décor of the Campus. Spread over a 15-acre land, right in the academic hub of the city, Islamabad Campus is steadily expanding both in terms of its area and study programs. </p>

                    <p> The purpose of Computer Science degree programs is to produce computer scientists, who can form the backbone of the rapidly growing computer industry. The BS program is focused on developing an in depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science through a rigorous course work spanning over a period of four years. Students are given unique opportunities to go beyond traditional computer science and get themselves involved in research activities through various research and industrial collaboration programs carried out at the campuses. This ensures a broad based educational foundation that prepares them for leadership roles along diverse career paths. </p>

                    <p> The Electrical Engineering degree is based on the HEC/PEC approved curriculum. In the first year the students learn the fundamentals of Electrical Engineering supported by essential mathematics and physics courses. These courses are followed by breadth courses which introduce students to different specialties in Electrical Engineering. In the senior year students choose a specialization stream and study advanced courses. Currently specializations are being offered in three areas, Telecommunication Engineering, and Computer Engineering. In the highly competitive job market a young engineer is not only required to be knowledgeable in technical areas but is also expected to have excellent communication and managerial skills and an appreciation of modern day economics to design and implement a cost effective engineering solution. Students are offered courses in communication skills, engineering management and economics to prepare them for challenging environments. Social Science electives and courses in Professional Ethics contribute in enhancing the soft skills and help prepare a well rounded personality. The course work is supported by state of the art engineering labs. During four years, students work in twelve different labs where they perform experiments using state of the art instruments, equipment and simulation software. </p>
